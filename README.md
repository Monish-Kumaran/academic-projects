## üìÇ Projects

### üîã [LoRa-Based Smart Energy Monitoring System](./LoRa_EnergyMonitoring/README.md)
- Designed a **smart energy meter** with Arduino and LoRa modules for long-range, low-power wireless transmission of household energy usage.  
- Provides **real-time monitoring** of voltage, current, and power with OLED display.  
- Improves billing accuracy and enables **smart grid applications**.

### üöó [Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication System](./V2V_Communication/README.md)
- Developed a **V2V safety prototype** using ESP32 microcontrollers.  
- Detects sudden braking with an **MPU6050 accelerometer** and sends a wireless alert to the following vehicle.  
- Receiver vehicle warns driver with **buzzer + LED** and checks obstacles with an ultrasonic sensor.  
- Demonstrates **collision avoidance** and the potential of **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)**.

### ü©ª [Kidney Stone Detection using Image Segmentation](./KidneyStoneDetection/README.md)
- Applied **deep learning (YOLOv8)** for medical image segmentation and kidney stone detection from CT scans.  
- Achieved **97% precision, 98.45% recall, and 97% F1-score** on test datasets.  
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation done with **Roboflow**; training performed in **Google Colab**.  
- Built a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for easy detection and visualization.
